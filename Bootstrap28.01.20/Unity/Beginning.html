  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><br>
  Unity is a development environment for programming games of all kinds. From powerful computer games to simple cell phone games,<br>
  everything is possible.<br>
  In Unity, 3D - 2D games or animated films can be produced.<br>
  Since unity was originally developed for 3d games, it is often called unity3d, which is not entirely correct.<br>
  In this course we will cover the most important steps from download to publication.<br><br><br>

  <h2 id="download">Download</h2>
  To download Unity you should first download Unity Hub because there you can easily download and view the different versions of Unity.
  Unity Hub can be downloaded <a href="https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download">here</a>.<br><br><br>

  <h2 id="create">Create the first project</h2>
  In order to create our first project we first open the Unity hub.
  If you have already created a project and you open Unity hub for the first time, click add and search for your project.
  In our case we don't have that and that's why we press new.
  With the arrow directly to the right of new you can change the version if you have more than one.<br>

  Now you can choose which type of you project should be the most important are <strong>2d</strong> and <strong>3d</strong>.<br><br>

  <strong>2D:</strong> a regular 2d game <br><br>
  <strong>3D:</strong> a regular 3d game <br><br>
  <strong>3D whith Extras:</strong> a 3d game with post processing<br><br>
  <strong>High-Definition Rp:</strong> 3d that uses the HD Render Pipeline<br><br>
  <strong>Lightweight RP:</strong> 3d that uses the Lightweight Render Pipeline<br><br>
  <strong>VR Lightweight RP:</strong> 3d with Lightweight VR Render Pipeline<br><br><br><br>

  Finally, we have to choose a name and the location.<br><br><br>
